        <p><font color=#FFD768>For too long has social media been concentrated on people's apperances. 
For too long have we been judged on the way we look in evevery single picture of us.
 We are judged by our appearance enough in our daily lives. 
Here at FacelessBook, we provide the people with the greatest social media ever invented. 
One where no faces are allowed. No longer do we need to worry about how we look in every picture and whether or not we're impressing those around us. 
Here at FacelessBook, we deploy the latest face recognition technology to remove any photos containing faces.
 You need not worry ever again of your friends posting embarrassing photos of you.</font> </p>
